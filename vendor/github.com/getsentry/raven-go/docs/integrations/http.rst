net/http
========

Raven Go provides middleware that can be used with the stdlib ``net/http`` library to
automatically handle panics that occur during an http request.

Installation
------------

Simply install ``raven-go`` through ``go get``::

    $ go get github.com/getsentry/raven-go

Setup
-----

Make sure that you've set configured ``raven`` with your DSN, typically inside the ``init()``
in your ``main`` package is a good place.

.. sourcecode:: go

    package main

    import "github.com/getsentry/raven-go"

    func init() {
        raven.SetDSN("___DSN___")
    }

If you don't call ``SetDSN``, we will attempt to read it from your environment under the
``SENTRY_DSN`` environment variable.

Next, we need to wrap our ``http.Handler`` with our ``RecoveryHandler``:

.. sourcecode:: go

    func root(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
        // ... do stuff
    }
    http.HandleFunc("/", raven.RecoveryHandler(root))
