# Environment variables used by this script (note that sensible defaults
# will be used where applicable).
# - EXPIRATION_WINDOW: the minimum time certificates must be valid for
#   in order to be included in the new release. The default is 0h, which
#   includes all currently validate certificates. This must be parsable by
#   Go's time package.
# - NOPUSH: do not push the release branch upstream.
# - ALLOW_SKIP_PR: allows the script to complete successfully without
#   creating a release if there are no changes to the bundles.  The
#   intended use for this is the scheduled cronjob, we only want to
#   create a release and PR if there are changes
# - TRUST_CONFIG_PATH: the path to a cfssl-trust configuration file. The
#   default is to not specify a configuration file; the cfssl-trust program
#   will check for one in the standard places.
# - TRUST_DATABASE_PATH: the path to the cfssl-trust cert database. This
#   must either be specified here or in a configuration file.

# Fail on errors and undefined expansions; print what is being executed
# at every step.
